Wear
sunscreen
If
I
could
offer
you
only
one
tip
for
the
future
sunscreen
would
be
it
The
longterm
benefits
of
sunscreen
have
been
proved
by
scientists
whereas
the
rest
of
my
advice
has
no
basis
more
reliable
than
my
own
meandering
experience
I
will
dispense
this
advice
now
Enjoy
the
power
and
beauty
of
your
youth
Oh
never
mind
You
will
not
understand
the
power
and
beauty
of
your
youth
until
theyve
faded
But
trust
me
in
20
years
youll
look
back
at
photos
of
yourself
and
recall
in
a
way
you
cant
grasp
now
how
much
possibility
lay
before
you
and
how
fabulous
you
really
looked
You
are
not
as
fat
as
you
imagine
Dont
worry
about
the
future
Or
worry
but
know
that
worrying
is
as
effective
as
trying
to
solve
an
algebra
equation
by
chewing
bubble
gum
The
real
troubles
in
your
life
are
apt
to
be
things
that
never
crossed
your
worried
mind
the
kind
that
blindside
you
at
4
pm
on
some
idle
Tuesday
Do
one
thing
every
day
that
scares
you
Sing
Dont
be
reckless
with
other
peoples
hearts
